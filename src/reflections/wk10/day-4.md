## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
* a userdefined value type used to represent a list of named integer constants. It helps improve readibility of the program. Can be converted to different data types.
## How can you modify an Enum?
* .ToList, .ToString. Any To statement for the most part.
## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
* I have used them on accessing a full list during a get request.
