## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
*  Value - will directly store the variable value in memory will accept both signed and unsigned literals.
*  Reference - will contain a memory address of a variable value because the reference types do not store the value directly in memory.
* Pointer data - will contain a memory address of the variable value. 
## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
* signed and unsigned integral types, floating point types(contain a decimal), decimal types(128 bit data the best used when dealing with monetary calculations), character types, boolian types. 
## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
* They are stored in memory through a string or object. Used as sort of a reference to relay data, they inherit directly from an object.
