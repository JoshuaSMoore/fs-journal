## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
* It is crucial for allowing us to grab information from another class and modify the behavior in your current class. It also helps with linking members of the derived class into one group such as BaseController for easier asccess.

## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

* You would write something similar to NewController : BaseController. No it only inherits the Base class. it allows each inherited instance to make changes on an individual bases. 
## How does accessibility affect inheritance?
*  They are huge because they modify what you can and cant see in the subclass.
