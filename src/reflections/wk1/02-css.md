# The Beauty of CSS
### What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
* A psuedo class is a fake element that allows you to define a special state of an element. 
### What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
* Specificity is a scoring system that is used to determine which style of code will be utilized when there are multiple conflicting codes being written. This can be utilized when you are want oen specific code to be applied for a large portion of the style sheet besides a minor area. 

### What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
* When using the !important feature it will ultimately override any previous code written in regards to that specific element. This can make debugging very confusing due to only being able to override the !important feature by inputting another !important, this can also result in very sloppy looking coding as well.
