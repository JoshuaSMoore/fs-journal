# GITTIN GUD!

## Why do we use Git?
* Git allows developers to work in parallel with their peers to make sure there are no coding conflicts within a project. It also opens the door for a repository which enables developers to revert back to the older version of code they were working on. 
## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
* Multiple branches within git allow for parallel developments within one project at the same time, each can have their own individual commitments take place in real time. This can be essential for team projects, testing out multiple options for a project and picking which works best, providing multiple drafts, or allowing a team to all take on the same specific part of a project without affecting each others work. 


## What is the difference between Git and GitHub
* Git is basically a location within the local repository that allows you to do all of the above such as create branches, revert back to older code commitments, and pull logs to ensure there are no errors. 
* Git Hub is a remote repository that is updated continuously by multiple developers. This allows those developers to to access, modify, and view the current code that is being pushed from each individuals local repository. This can be a game changer for peer feedback, when multiple drafts of the same project are needing to be done, or when each individual has a specific job within the project and there needs to be a hub location to merge the code to provide the overall outcome.
