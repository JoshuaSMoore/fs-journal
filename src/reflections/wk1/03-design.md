### What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

* I liked a lot of the tips since most of them were very simple things that you can do or not do that make a world of a difference with the overall outcome of your page design. I would say that my favorite was the tip in regard to not relying so heavily on borders. I think that the clevar tricks you can use such as using box shadows, increasing your spacing, or using different background colors can really go a long way when it comes to how the design flows.

### Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

* This article was great when it came to providing options for resources to help yourself out a bit when it comes to design. A few of them would include, Zondicons, Font Awesome, Dribble, and Material Design Guidelines. 

### How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

* Good design is a huge factor in how people are influenced when visiting a website. A clean design can instantly result in people experiencing a sense of professionalism, trust, excitement, and many other positives when they visit a website. Especially if it is their first time going to a particular website, it can make or break many scenarios such as the individual making a purchase on that website, feeling its legitmate, or even recommending that website to others.
