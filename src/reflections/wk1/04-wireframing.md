# Frame Your Life

What is the purpose of wire-framing?

* The purpose of wire-framing is to get an overall layout and visual of what you are about to create. Having a blueprint is going to make things signficantly easier and allows you to make some great visual decisions prior to the actual coding phase.

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

* Low, mid, and high fidelity wire-frames are different levels. Ultimately each allows you to go deeper and deeper into the design phase and add more detail to what you are coding.

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

* Personally I think that wire-frames are vital for any project and without a doubt worth the time, energy, and effort. This is especially crucial when there is a specific design in mind right off the bat. Its similar to having a blank piece of paper and starting from scratch vs having a replica next to you that you are basing your project off of. If there is a specific goal ahead of time it takes the stress of the unknown and allows you to work towards something right away.
