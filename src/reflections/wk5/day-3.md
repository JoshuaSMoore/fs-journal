## How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?
* to add you would create whatever item you are looking to create, in the example they are creating a character by doing New Character =, then you would save the addition.
Editting you would use the findOne to find the document you are looking to edit get the array, make the changes, and run Save in order to lock it in.
