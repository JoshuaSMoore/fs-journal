## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
* A user experience is what the end user is going to go through when using your software. You need to always look at things from a User mindset. Just because you think that your code is easy to work with or navigate doesnt mean it will be for everyone. Focus on your client and who you are delivering the final product to. 
## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
* Benefits are you think about all circumstances and make sure your code is user friendly. From accessibility to easy navigation. The user experience is key to success.
## Why is the User Experience important?
* At the end of the day the user does not care about how much time and effort you put into making your code come to life. They care about what they get from the code and the overrall experience they have. If the experience is incredible they are way more likely to recommend you and call on you in the future.
