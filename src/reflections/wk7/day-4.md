## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
* Attempted to implement the partner programming aspect as well as really thought about the user experience. Did my best to be concious of the notes as well and helping future me out.
## What went well?
* User experience coding this weekend has paid off greatly, its made me realize less is more and keep things simple and functional. Notes have helped out a lot as well when it comes to running into road blocks and noting them and moving on.
## What would you do differently?
* Be more diligent about partner programming and planning things out from the start, especially in a larger group than 2. You need to make sure you are all on the same page the whole time in order to succeed.
