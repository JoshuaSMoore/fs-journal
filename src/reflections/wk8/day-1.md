## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
* It help display the type of work that the individual developer is able to accomplish as well as give a hands on deeper look into the code itself. This is huge if companies are looking for a specific style/task that they need to be able to be completed.
## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
* How active the portfolio pushes are, the coding proficiency and the overall qulity of the projects that are being worked on. I think a huge aspect as well is the growth, if there is a distinct upwards trend when it comes to the quality of work over a specific amount of time it shows the ability of the developer to grow and adapt to constant change.
## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
* I would clean up basically every single project that I have created, I would probably include site clone since that was the very basic beginning, and then items such as inspire, the network, and buglug. The reasons are because siteclone was the very start and showed the ground level, inspire was simple yet had a lot going on code wise, network was a great display of a social format, and buglog was a handling both back end and front end to accomplish very specific things. Once completed I would include the capstone + final as well.
