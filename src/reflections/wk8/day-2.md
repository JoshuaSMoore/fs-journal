## Why is communication on a small team important?
* This is key in all aspects, from developing the initial idea to the steps it will take to complete. There is no team that can succeed if everyone is doing their own thing and individually working on items. THey need to be working together, know what every person is doing, have stand ups regularly to check in on progress and work as a team for the harder logic that needs to be dealt with.
## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
* I would say the main adjustments are the amount of stand ups that take place, the task size that is provided, and the communication during the work of each backlog item. 
## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
* It is made up of quality, price, speed. The trade offs are self explanitory. 
Fast + lower price = lower quality.
Quality + Fast = Higher Price
Quality + Lower Price = Slower Speed
