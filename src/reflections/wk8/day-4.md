## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
* component testing which provides individual testing of each component, intregration testing which is supposed to provide a test to ensure all components work together, and end to end testing which is testing the overall application from a standpoint of a user. 
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
* I think all are the most useful in reality. However I would say that end to end mixed with integration testing are the most important since one makes sure that everything works in harmony from a component standpoint and the other is focused on the user experience which is absolutely key to a successful app.
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
* I would say component testing, I think its still a good practice however just knowing an individual component is working okay isnt quite as important as the integrationa aspect of the components.
