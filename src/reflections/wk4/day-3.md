## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
* To allow for easier debugging of code, better orginisation and structure and to help making chained functions easy to manage. 

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
* The client function MUST be defined as async for it to work. They go hand in hand.

## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
* Better coding, easier to manage coding, easier debugging of code, makes asynchronous code look synchronous and non blocking behind the scenes. Help making chained functions a lot easier to manage.
