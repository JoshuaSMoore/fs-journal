## What is Scope ?
* Scope means where the variables are available for use. Declorations are globally scoped while a function is locally scoped. 
## What is Hoisting ?
* Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanic where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed. 
## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
* Let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. Const will not allow you to change the variables value at all in the code so you would only choose this when it is 100% set in stone.
