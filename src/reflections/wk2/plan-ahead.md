# Take your time, dont jump in blind

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
It is very hard to jump into a blank code and just send it and hope that ideas come to you. By planning ahead and getting a layout before you jump into the coding process you are able to basically outline your project and fill in the gaps. I think you can get stuck going down a rabbit hole if you just start coding and see what comes out.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Use your resources, if you are in a classroom enviroment ask for help, if you are on your own the internet literally has every question asked on there, it just comes down to how hard you are willing to look for an answer.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
* Use your resources, use your tools, and dont allow yourself to get hungup on one individual piece for super long periods of time. There are so many options out there for finding answers to specific scenarios, if its not a code breaking issue move on, and loop back when youve found the resources and have a fresh outlook on the issue.
