## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
* It is used for bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit.  

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
* For one a large number of people ignore or are unaware of the underscore convention so they woulnt take it into consideration and it would lead to breaking changes. This resulted in users having direct access to underlying data structures which is a big nono.
Also this severely highteneded the potential for hacking to come into play. 
## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
* get and set are offering a more simplified definition for getters and setters that were previously defined different and include the privacy updates of the new es6 class. Privacy is key to keeping a product/app healthy and being able to be aware of true issues within the code that arent caused by an outside source.
