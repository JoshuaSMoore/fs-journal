# Efficiency is Key

## What problem does using exports solve?
* It allows you to access your information where you want as well as keep the information private. Very good for going through and determining what you want the end user to have access to vs what you want to have available for devs.
## How does export differ from export default?
* Default forces everything within the file to be exported and available where it is being exported too. While Export is specific information based off of the location that was exported. Can be very specific and can hide information you do not want to be available.
## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
* It is a game changer when it comes to categorizing information in a easy to understand and read way as well as being able to grab very specific information and create a application that only allows the user access to what you specifically want to allow and ensures everything that should be hidden is only available on the back end side in a very organized manner.
