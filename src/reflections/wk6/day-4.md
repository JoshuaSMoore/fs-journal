## What is a nested route?
* A route with params to basically add to the url that is being called, so for instance we used this for going to a users profile page, it would keep the base route and add the user Id to the end in order to complete this call.
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
* going to a users profile page, pulling up a blog post or something along those lines to access more data about the post such as comments.

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
* Yes, you can definitely do this, I used a few examples above, going to a specific users profile, or pulling up a specific post based off of its iD.
