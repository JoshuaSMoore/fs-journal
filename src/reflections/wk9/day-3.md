## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
* Scrum with a smaller team can happen a lot more frequently, when roadblocks take place they can be handled by the group instead of just an individual, there is a lot more communication when it comes to what is being done and the timelines and struggles that take place. There is more responsibility with the individual to be open and honest so theteam can assist.
## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
* Because multiple sprints cannot be juggled, we work in states of done. if you have a deadline you can run a few sprints to meet that deadline but running one sprint at a time ensures everyone is one the same page, everyone is moving forward progress wise, and that you stay on track to complete the overall project on time. It also allows you to determine where your struggles may lie and what areas might need more time.
## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
* It is made up of quality, price, speed. The trade offs are self explanitory. 
Fast + lower price = lower quality.
Quality + Fast = Higher Price
Quality + Lower Price = Slower Speed
