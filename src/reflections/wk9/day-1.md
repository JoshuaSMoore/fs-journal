## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
* vs code, vue, javascript, SOLID principle, CRUD

## What went well so far?
* teamwork makes dreamwork, scrum has made a huge difference when it comes to keeping on track and making goals that are achieveable in the timeframe alloted. Naming convention talks with the team to make sure everyone is on the same page. Honesty when it comes to people speaking to their strengths and weaknesses and making sure they are in a position where they not only can help the team the most but get the most out of the project on an individual leaning basis.

## What would you do differently? Why?
* Be more willing to jump into things that are harder to tackle. Work harder for problem solving without needing or asking for help until it becomes a time block. And digging deeper into the overall MVP to ensure the app size doesnt go from a SPA to multiple SPAs.
