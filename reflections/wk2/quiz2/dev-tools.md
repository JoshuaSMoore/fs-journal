# Debug your life

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
* The console is a godsend for developers. It allows us to confirm our work in small pieces and focus on getting part by part operating and done before jumping straight to the bigger picture. If you have every piece working correctly the whole project will come together. 

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
* The elements tab is awesome for looking into your direct code and manipulating it to test things out and see whats taking place. this is huge for testing theories as well as problem solving through debugging.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
* the debugger is absolutely key to debugging your code. It will break down what is taking place piece by piece and allow you to see exactly where the code is failing and make improvements on the fly.
