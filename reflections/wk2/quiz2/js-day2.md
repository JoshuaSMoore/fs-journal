# Function Junction

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
* Function Declaration, Function Expression, Arrow Function Expression. 
* Declaration - defines a named function.
* Expression defines a named or anonymous funtion.
* Arrow - is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions.

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

* Parameters are used when defining a function. The names that are created within the function definition. 

* Arguments are the values that the function recieves from another parameter when the function is invoked. 
## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

* A higher order function is when a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function. 
* array.find, array.include are examples of this.
